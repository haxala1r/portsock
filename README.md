# The Portable Sockets Library.

This is a library aiming to provide a reasonable, reliable and cross-platform
sockets interface for C++.

As you may know, networking is kind of a pain as most code using raw
sockets can be horribly difficult to port to other systems. This library
provides a simple abstraction over the raw sockets so that you can compile
the same code for different operating systems with ease.
